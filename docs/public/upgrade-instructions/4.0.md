# Instructions to upgrade to Cordova plugin version to 4.0

This chapter describes the steps to take in order to migrate from Cordova plugin 3.0 to 4.0.

## Mobile authentication

The mobile authentication configuration is changed. We switched from GCM to FCM. In order to enable monile authentication you must make sure that your project
is imported into FCM. See the next paragraph. Also you must download the `google-services.json` file from the FCM console and place that into the root of your 
project.

### Import your GCM project as a Firebase project

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com).
2. Follow the instructions described in [Import your GCM project as a Firebase project section of the GCM to FCM migration guide](https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/android/android-migrate-fcm#import_your_gcm_project_as_a_firebase_project).

### Remove the GCM sender id property

Due to the migration to FCM the GCM Sender Id property (`OneginiGcmSenderId`) is no longer used and should be removed from your `config.xml`.
