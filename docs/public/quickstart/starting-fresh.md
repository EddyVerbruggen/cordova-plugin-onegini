# Starting fresh

Let's grab the example app from GitHub..

    git clone https://github.com/Onegini/cordova-example-app
    cd cordova-example-app
    
.. and follow the [installation guide](../installation/introduction.md).

You should then be able to deploy the example app to your device or simulator and test all the plugin's features:

    cordova run ios
    cordova run android
