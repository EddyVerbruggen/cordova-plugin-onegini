# 3. How to customize native PIN screen

In order to change UI elements, like buttons, texts or background image you have to modify/override drawables accordingly. Drawables are part of cordova-onegini-native-screens plugin. 
When customizing the views in this plugin we strongly recommend **forking** and **renaming** this plugin instead of editing this project directly.
