# Getting started

The cordova-onegini-plugin is an Apache Cordova plugin build to allow use of Onegini's native SDKs in order to create Cordova applications.

The plugin currently supports the following platforms:
  - Android
  - iOS

The Plugin allows to perform native code invocations on Onegini's SDK directly from the Javascript layer of the top level application. To read more about the plugin's public APIs documentation see the [Interface](interface.md) chapter.
