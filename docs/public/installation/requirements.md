# Requirements

To be able to create an Apache Cordova project you'll need to install several tools. Everything is explained perfectly on the Cordova website, so please refer to the [Apache Cordova getting started guide](https://cordova.apache.org/#getstarted). This will guide you through setting up npm, Cordova, Xcode, and the Android SDK's (depending on the platforms you want to target).

> Note that if you want to create an iOS application you'll need a Mac to build and debug your application.
