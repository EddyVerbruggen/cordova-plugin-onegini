Make sure you meet the requirements before you continue.

## Creating a Cordova app

You may already have an app you want to add the plugin to, but if not you can easily create one with the Cordova Command Line Interface (CLI):

    cordova create <PATH> [ID [NAME [CONFIG]]] [options]
    
Example:

    cordova create ./myapp com.mycompany.myapp "My App"
    
## Adding the plugin to your app

The Onegini plugin can be added like any other "Plugman compatible" Cordova plugin. From the root of your project do:

    cordova plugin add https://github.com/Onegini/cordova-plugin-onegini
